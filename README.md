# Pushing Code
- Step 1. Git pull in your local desktop
- Step 2. Create a new development branch in which you will implement your changes. Can use the following command `git checkout -b 'example_branch_name'` (this will create new branch and move you there).
- Step 3. Once you've finished implementing your changes add the corresponding files (`git add .`), commit them (`git commit -m 'example_commit_message'`) and push them (`git push`).
- Step 4. Navigate to the github repo on your browser, find your code changes or go to Pull Request (it might automatically prompt you for this). Then create the new Pull Request following the instructions there, if introducing big changes try to be descriptive on what it is you did (what steps you took, how you tested it works, etc) and if there's an issue creted for this reference the PR there as well and close it.
